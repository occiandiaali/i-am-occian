            <p>Formerly known as <strong>Patrick Chukwufumnanya Diali</strong>, I spent 20 years as a broadcast media professional (in television, videography, and radio) before deciding to enter the field of I.T. and switched from a hardware engineering focus to software development because SOFTWARE ROCKS!</p>
            <p>I volunteer to teach web development to teenagers in the summer with <a href="/">TeenCode Africa</a></p>
            <p>I am largely self-taught, and have participated in a bootcamp/sprints with <a href="/">Andela.</a> </p>
            <p>I have been certified by Cisco (CCENT &amp; CCNA), CompTia (Network+ &amp; Security+), and Microsoft (MTA &amp; MCP)</p>
